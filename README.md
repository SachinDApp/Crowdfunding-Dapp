this is the dapp. In this Dapp first we create proposal to be funded and investors fund it according to their preference.



This is the CrowdFunding project that i have made using React js, tailwind css and smart contract at the etherium blockchain testnet 
Sepolia.
make sure that node is installed.
1. go to client folder and then thirdweb folder.
2. npm install, to install all the dependencies.
3. npm run dev, to run the front end code.
4. if you want to deploy your own smart contract, the use thirweb command to deploy smart contract. but before this go to thirweb-contracts 
folder and run, npm install, to install dependencies.
5. after all this you now have your own smart contract.
